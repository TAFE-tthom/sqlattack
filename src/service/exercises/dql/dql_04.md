## Select - Cities - 4

Similar to exercise 3, introduce an additional clause to your query.

Retrieve all cities that start with the letter `F` and has a country code of `23`.

---

The database in use is `Sakila`.

You have access to the following tables:

* `city`
  * `city_id`, int
  * `city`, varchar/text
  * `country_id`, int
  * `last_update`, timestamp

Make sure you wait for the database to finish loading before running a query.
