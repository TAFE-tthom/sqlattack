## Create Table - Authors and Books

Using your table you have created from the last exercise, you will need to introduce a new table and also introduce a new column in `Book`.

You will need to create a table called `Author`, which will contain the following columns.

* `author_id`, `INT` - An integer identifier for the author, this is also the primary key.
* `first_name`, `VARCHAR(50)` - First name of the author.
* `last_name`, `VARCHAR(50)` - Last name of the author.

**Please note**: Order of statements does matter! If you use a foreign key, the table it is referring to must already exist before executing it. 

With the `Book` table, most of the columns will remain the same however `author_id` will need to be introduced into your create table statement.

* `isbn_11`, `CHAR(12)` - ISBN number that will be used as a primary key.
* `title`, `VARCHAR(56)` - Title of the book
* `description`, `VARCHAR(200)` - A simple description of the book.
* `author_id`, `INT` - Foreign key that refers to `Author` table.

Make sure it meets the above specifications and that you use `CREATE TABLE`, to ensure that the table is created and ready for data to be inserted.

Insert statements will be executed after constructing the table. The database is reset on submissions to ensure that you don't need to alter/delete the table.
