## Alter Tables - 5

Oops! Someone forgot the `discount` column in the `Product` table.

Could you please `ALTER` the table and add the column `discount` with the datatype `DECIMAL`.

You will have access to the `PointOfSale` database, this, implementation has the issue above but may be used later on in a different instance.
