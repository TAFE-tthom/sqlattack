The following tables are unnecessary and will need to be removed.

* InvoiceLogs
* PaymentProcessors

The remaining tables should be:

* Product
* LineItem
* Sale

You will have access to the `PointOfSale` database, this, implementation has the issue above but may be used later on in a different instance.
