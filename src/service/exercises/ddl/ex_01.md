## Create Table - Book

You have been tasked with creating a table that will hold data about books. The `Book` table will need to hold the following information:

* `isbn_11`, `CHAR(12)` - ISBN number that will be used as a primary key.
* `title`, `VARCHAR(56)` - Title of the book
* `description`, `VARCHAR(200)` - A simple description of the book.

Make sure it meets the above specifications and that you use `CREATE TABLE`, to ensure that the table is created and ready for data to be inserted.

Insert statements will be executed after constructing the table. The database is reset on submissions to ensure that you don't need to alter/delete the table.
