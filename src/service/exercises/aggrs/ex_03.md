## Customers and Rentals (But with counts!)

You have been tasked with finding out how many rentals each customer has made. As a hint, you should use a `LEFT JOIN` in this instance.

Your query should ensure that the customer's first and last name are printed first. The count should next to their name.


Your query should output the following columns:

* `first_name`
* `last_name`
* `rental_count`

You have access to the following tables:

* `customer`
  * `customer_id`, `INT`
  * `store_id`, `INT`
  * `first_name`, `VARCHAR`
  * `last_name`, `VARCHAR`
  * `email`, `VARCHAR`
  * `address_id`, `INT`
  * `active`, `BOOLEAN`

* `rental`
  * `rental_id`, `INT`
  * `rental_date`, `DATETIME`
  * `inventory_id`, `INT`
  * `customer_id`, `INT`
  * `return_date`, `INT`
  * `staff_id`, `INT`

Make sure you wait for the database to finish loading before running a query.
