## Deleting Products

Well! Looks like the supplier of DVDs and RAM are going out of business. We will be delisting them from our database. Make sure you remove the following entries from the `Product` table.

Remember the columns;

* `Product`
  * `product_id`, `INT`
  * `name`, `VARCHAR(40)`
  * `price`, `DECIMAL`

Below are the products to be removed from the `Product` table.

| ID | Name                        |
| -- | ----------------------------| 
| 12 | Blank DVD                   |
| 89 | 8GB DDR Ram (3200mhz)       |

Make sure you remove both items from the database.
