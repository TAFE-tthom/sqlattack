## Inserting Multiple Products

Oh no! Looks like the other bit of software that handles entering products using their barcode has failed! Fortunately, after having learned how to insert a single product before, you can many more now!

Remember the columns;

* `Product`
  * `product_id`, `INT`
  * `name`, `VARCHAR(40)`
  * `price`, `DECIMAL`

Here is the list of products to enter in, you have been given IDs this time.

| ID | Name                        | Price |
| -- | ----------------------------|-------|
| 2  | A piece of string           | 0.5   |
| 3  | Cola - With Sugar           | 5.5   |
| 5  | Jelly Beans (Not Edible)    | 2.25  |
| 10 | Blank CD                    | 12.55 |
| 12 | Blank DVD                   | 7.5   |
| 89 | 8GB DDR Ram (3200mhz)       | 760.5 |


You can have multiple insert statements or you can use 1 insert statement.
