## Multi-Columns - 2

The previous exercise demonstrated how to output text data as a single column. You can output multiple pieces of data.

Your task is to output 3 different data types. Use the following:

* `'String'`,
* `42`,
* `true`

When using a `SELECT` statement, you should separate each piece using a comma (`,`). 

Example:


```sql
SELECT 'Ricky', 'Davidson';
```

Remember:

* Integer datatypes don't need quotes around them.

* Boolean datatypes also don't need quotes around them

Expected Output:

```
String, 42, 1
```

(Something to consider, why did `true` turn into 1?)
