## DataTypes - Numbers

We now look at datatypes that represent numbers.

### Numbers

There are two common representations of numbers. `INTEGER` and `REAL` (`REAL` is usually referred to as `FLOAT` or `DOUBLE`).

`INTEGER` or `INT`, represent the integer set of numbers, these are number which are not fractions such as `-1`, `1` and `10`.

`REAL` or `FLOAT`, are floating point numbers, these have a precision component and are intended to represent the real number set.

### Boolean

`BOOLEAN`, which is a representation of an integer, represents two values. `true` and `false`.

This representation is useful for making decisions with code.


### Date and Time

Date and datetime datatypes assist with keeping track and recording information with our records.

We will see more about these datatypes later.
