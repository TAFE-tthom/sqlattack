## Capitalisation

You have been tasked with otuputting the list of names but with capitalisation. You will need to use a mix of functions to achieve this.

Consider the following functions:

* `SUBSTRING`
* `LOWER`
* `UPPER`
* `CONCAT`

Do note, you can take the value that would be returned by the function as an argument for another.

### Reference

You have access to the following tables:

* `actor`
  * `actor_id`, `INT`
  * `first_name`, `VARCHAR`
  * `last_name`, `VARCHAR`

Make sure you wait for the database to finish loading before running a query.
