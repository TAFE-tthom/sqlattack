## Outputting Fullnames

You have been tasked with creating a query that will output all actors first name and last name in a single column. You will need to use the `CONCAT` function or `||` operator to merge the two columns into one.

### Reference

* [SQLite Functions](https://sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html)

You have access to the following tables:

* `actor`
  * `actor_id`, `INT`
  * `first_name`, `VARCHAR`
  * `last_name`, `VARCHAR`

Make sure you wait for the database to finish loading before running a query.
