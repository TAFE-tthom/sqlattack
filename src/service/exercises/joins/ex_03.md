## Create Table - Autoincrement

You will need to create a table called `Ticket`, what is special about this table is that the `primary key` will be automatically generated upon insertion.

The table will have the following columns.

* `ticket_id`, `INT` - When a new ticket is added to the table, the id will be generated (incremented). Make sure you use `AUTOINCREMENT` and set this as the primary key.

* `ticket_origin`, `VARCHAR(50)` - Store a username based on who created the ticket.

* `ticket_description`, `VARCHAR(500)` - Description of the ticket.

* `resolved`, `BOOLEAN` - Outlines if the ticket has been resolved or not.

When inserting data into this table, it shouldn't be required to specify the `ticket_id` column in the `INSERT` statement.

Do note, with SQL vendors, `AUTOINCREMENT` is not universal to all implementations. Within the database we are currently using, we will be utilising it and this is similar to **MySQL/MariaDB** version of `AUTO_INCREMENT`.

PostgreSQL uses `SERIAL`.

T-SQL uses `IDENTITY`.

This is useful information to know because this is just a single example where vendors provide their own implementation here that you will need to use.

Insert statements will be executed after constructing the table. The database is reset on submissions to ensure that you don't need to alter/delete the table.
